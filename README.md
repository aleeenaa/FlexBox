# FlexBox

NOTE: Designed in Netbeans IDE.

The  application  that  I  have  designed  is  for  a  company  called  FlexBox  which  sell  boxes  of 

customizable sizes with addable features. The application was created using an Object Oriented 

Approach. The application allows you to pick the size constraints; length, height and width of the 

box, then the grade of the card being the type of card to be used for said box. Next is how many 

colours  you would like the  card to be; there is a  choice from  zero, one or two  colours. Extra 

features  are  whether  the  box  should  have  a  sealable  top,  reinforced  bottoms  and reinforced 

corners. The company ‘FlexBox’ specifically create 5 types of boxes which the customers are 

unbeknownst to. Therefore when a box selection is made, not matching one of the five, an error 

message will show up informing them that type of box is not available/made by FlexBox.
